# Problem And Goal

## <a name="assumptions">Problem</a>
- It is very hard for working parents to keep their children busy during school
holidays
- Playgroup sessions are good to bring children together and have fun and socialise

## <a name="assumptions">Product Goal</a>
Help working parents work collaboratively to keep their children busy and happy
with playgroup sessions during school holidays

- Working parents find other parents to look after their kids while they are at work,
especially during school holidays
- Working parents can also look after other parent’s children in return
- Parents can welcome children to their house in order to keep their children
socialised and improve their children's social skills

# Five User Stories

## USER STORY 1 : Create a Playgroup
As a parent who has some time to spend with children, I want to create a playgroup session depending
on my availability, so that my kids can play with other kids at our house and socialise during school
holidays

## USER STORY 2 : List Playgroups
As a PlayTime app user, I want to see the playgroup sessions with vacancy, so that I can make bookings for my
daughter and I don’t need to take a day off from work

## USER STORY 3 : Join a Playgroup
As a working parent using PlayTime app, I want my children to join a playgroup session created by other
parents, so that I can leave my kids to people I know and let my children have good time under their
supervision

## USER STORY 4 : Cancel/Reschedule a Playgroup
As a parent who has created a playgroup session on Playtime app, I can only reschedule or cancel the playgroup
session more than 4 hours before the start of the session, so that the other parents can organise their days
accordingly

## USER STORY 5 : Send notification to user when a new playgroup is created
As a working parent, I want to know the playgroup vacancies as soon they are created so that I can book my kid’s
place in the playgroup before anyone else

# Assumptions

- The user is asked about their residential state when they sign up, so the application provides school holiday calendar for the
given state
- The Calendar shows only the Playground sessions within 2km to the school area which have vacancy
- The application doesn’t allow a user to supervise more than 6 children for a playgroup
- Since the product will be available only in Australia, only English language is supported.
- The app shows the current or next closest Term’s School Holidays calendar by default
- The app also works when no network is available to check the playgroup session from the last online usage. But the user can
create or join a session when he/she is online.
- The app can also be opened when no network is available
- The app provides two 4-hour playgroup sessions a day by default:
- 08:30 - 12:30 - morning session
- 13:00 - 17:00 - afternoon session
- The user is only allowed to reserve 4-hour-sessions, not less

# Prioritization Logic

The app predominately aims to provide a shared calendar between users so that they can create a playgroup or
join an existing one.
- In terms of practicality and a better error prevention, users should be given enough flexibility to make a change
and contact each other, for MVP only telephone numbers of users are provided, in following sprints on-product
messaging and chat rooms will be added.
- The most important feature is selected as __USER STORY 1 - CREATE A PLAYGROUP SESSION__ due to the fact that
nobody can join a session without knowing who has some availability to spend with children. To understand how
interested people are in this application, without any further investment the MVP version can even just start with
just providing the organiser's telephone number and letting them call each other and arrange booking outside the
app.
- __USER STORY 2 - LIST PLAYGROUP__ is one of the important features letting the users to discover and find playgroups
- __USER STORY 4 - CANCEL/RESCHEDULE PLAYGROUP__ is especially for error prevention letting the playgroup organiser
to take action when something urgent happens and let the other parents change their plans
- __USER STORY 3 - JOIN A PLAYGROUP__ connecting the parents without needing to make a phone call and let them
arrange their time with a single click. This comes after USER STORY 2 in list, because this requires first to find the
available playgroup that matches with a parent time schedule and then joining a session. This can be broaden with
a Request to join-Approve/Reject feature in the next releases
- __USER STORY 5 - NOTIFY USERS WHEN A NEW PLAYGROUP IS CREATED__ aims better retention rate, informing
users of new playgroup sessions and let them come back to product more often
