title: I am super excited
summary: |-
        I am super excited.
        Finally, I have published my first blog page.
        It was funny.
        I used the parallax effect library
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt"
           style="fontWeight:bold; color:#4299E1"><b>react-parallax-tilt</b></a>.
        Do you know how?

# What do I want?

Most of the time, the ___Hello___ and ___World___ words come to my mind
especially when I start blogging. To be honest, I couldn't succeed in
consistently publishing blog posts.

I would love to start with the topic of
[Hello World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
for the sake of being classic. As you see on top of the page,
the post is relatively a different variant of the ___Hello World___ type.
Little bit more chocolate box.

    />

    What I want is to post my first blog page,
    which includes a mix of ___[comic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book)___
    and ___[photo comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_comics)___ types.

# What do I need?

One of the most liked factors in comics is background design.
I'm not a designer. So, I had to use free on-ready assets
for a background design that is a futuristic one.

[Pexels](pexels.com) came to the rescue at that time.
__Dark__ and <b style={{color:"#00008B"}}>blue</b> tone background that was what I wanted.

As you see, I chose myself as the main character in the photo comics.
He is a good actor himself. üôÇ

Further, I needed an open-source application to edit the background image and my image.
I went for [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) not only is it an illustration application,
but it is also handy for editing images.

For the first time, I moved down in the world.
It was a little different, unlike any other photo editor I have used before.
Probably you know that application. I don't want to
advertise it is already a famous one.
But, I got used to using it by the time of progress.

        I left the background as a photo comic's style

        I applied comic
        book's style effect on myself.
    </Components.Chakra.Flex>
</Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid>

I believed that the picture shouldn't consist only of images.
There should have motion in it to make it a little attractive.
When you moved your mouse over on it, you should have felt perspective in the scene.

I made use of the [react-parallax-tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt)
library to make perspective feel happens. In this total of 4 scenes mini-series,
I played a lead role in all of 4 parts.

<Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid columns={[1, null, 2]} spacing='40px'>

    The __first scene__ shows that
    I get into deep water with fears.

    <Components.CartoonBox
        imagePath="/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/"
        images={["iam-super-excited-1-1.png","iam-super-excited-1-2.png"]}/>

    In the __second scene__, you can find out that
    I quell fears in my eyes as clear
    as the sky is blue. (not blue my eyes)

    <Components.CartoonBox
        imagePath="/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/"
        images={["iam-super-excited-2-1.png","iam-super-excited-2-2.png"]}/>


    In the __third scene__ I don't show my face.
    But, I have got an actor's line that I am saying ___I'm gonna do it___.
    If you read until here, this means "YES! I did it". Congratulations to myself ü§ù

    <Components.CartoonBox
        imagePath="/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/"
        images={["iam-super-excited-3-1.png","iam-super-excited-3-2.png"]}/>


    In the __fourth scene__,
    I hadn't hesitated to leave aside
    my unnecessary fears and take action immediately.
    I pushed the button to publish my first blog page to let it meet you all.

    <Components.CartoonBox
        imagePath="/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/"
        images={["iam-super-excited-4-1.png","iam-super-excited-4-2.png"]}/>

Academy loved the role I played in the __Face your fears to publish your first blog post to communities__ mini-movie.
The best-supporting actor Oscar that I won. üèÜ (come on, this is not Oscar)


# How I did

<Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid columns={[1, null, 2]} spacing='40px'>
    ___STEP 1.___ Searching for the correct [image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/light-people-dark-playing-6499175/),
    and I found it. Thank you [Tima Miroshnichenko](https://www.pexels.com/@tima-miroshnichenko)

    <Components.BImage
        src={`/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/iam-super-excited-2-1.png`}
        title={"background"}
        rotate={-2}
    />

    ___STEP 2.___ [react-parallax-tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt) helped me to make animated perspectives easily.
    And I needed various layers of an image to use in react-parallax-tilt.

    <Components.BImage
        src={`/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/react-parallax-tilt.gif`}
        title={"react-parallax-tilt"}
        rotate={2}
    />


    ___STEP 3.___ With the help of the [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) tool,
    I separated the image background and foreground into layers.

    <Components.BImage
        src={`/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/kritaTool.png`}
        title={"krita tool"}
        rotate={-3}
    />


    ___STEP 3.1.___ I export my image as a transparent png file.

    <Components.BImage
        src={`/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/iam-super-excited-2-2.png`}
        title={"my transparent image"}
        rotate={2}
    />

    ___STEP 3.2.___ I found a transparent speech balloon image and put it on to the scene and export it as a transparent png file.

    <Components.BImage
        src={`/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/iam-super-excited-2-3.png`}
        title={"transparent speech balloon "}
        rotate={-1}
    />

    ___STEP 3.3.___ I export the background png file.

    <Components.BImage
        src={`/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/iam-super-excited-2-1.png`}
        title={"background image"}
        rotate={-3}
    />

    ___STEP 3.4.___ I developed a small component names is __CartoonBox__ component that uses [react-parallax-tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt).
    It combines all the images. To animate the speech balloon when mouse over I used [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/) library.

    <Components.CartoonBox
        imagePath="/images/journals/i-am-super-excited/"
        images={["iam-super-excited-2-1.png","iam-super-excited-2-2.png"]}
        speechBalloonImage="iam-super-excited-2-3.png"/>
