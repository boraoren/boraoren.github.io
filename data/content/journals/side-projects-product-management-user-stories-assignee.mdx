Transforms how teams collaborate and manage tasks within my tool.

Now, each user story can be assigned to specific team members,
bringing clarity to who is responsible for what.
This assignment not only streamlines task management
but also boosts accountability and efficiency.
Team members can easily track their responsibilities,
and project leads gain a clear overview of task distribution and progress.

By fostering a more organized approach to task delegation,
this update is set to significantly enhance team collaboration
and productivity.
