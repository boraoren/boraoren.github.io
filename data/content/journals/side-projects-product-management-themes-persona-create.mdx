    In [user story mapping in agile](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-story-mapping/),
    a persona is a fictional character that represents a specific group
    of users or a user archetype. These personas are created based on
    user research and include detailed character sketches that outline
    the personas' demographics, behaviors, needs, and goals.

In the context of user story mapping,
personas help the development team to understand and prioritize
the needs and experiences of different user types, ensuring that
the product features and user journeys are designed to suit the
end users' perspectives and requirements.

And yes I can use personas for themes.
Personas represent specific user groups,
and themes are broad focus areas in your product or service.
By aligning themes with personas, you can ensure that
each theme addresses the needs, behaviors,
and goals of its respective user group.
This alignment helps in creating more targeted
and user-centric themes, enhancing the relevance
and effectiveness of your product's features and functionalities.
