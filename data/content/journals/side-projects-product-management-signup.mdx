In the digital age, the signup feature is the gateway
to user engagement. It's not just about creating an account;
it's about crafting a secure and welcoming entry point for users.
A well-designed signup process begins with a user-friendly interface,
guiding users through easy yet secure steps.

Email verification is a critical layer in this process,
ensuring authenticity and paving the way for future communications.
Moreover, the introduction of strong password requirements fortifies
user accounts against unauthorized access.

Take a look at the features I've implemented.

<Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid columns={[1, null, 2]} spacing='40px'>

    __1.__ After entering their information, the user is prompted to check their email for verification.
    <video src="/videos/side-projects/product-management/signUpCheckYourEmail-1.mp4"
               controls="controls" style={{maxWidth: 400, borderRadius: 15}}>
    </video>

    __2.__ If the user hasn't verified their email, they receive a notification: "User email is not verified."`
    <video src="/videos/side-projects/product-management/signUpCheckYourEmail-2.mp4"
           controls="controls" style={{maxWidth: 400, borderRadius: 15}}>
    </video>

    __3.__ The user should check their email (using [maildev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev) for test environment)
    <video src="/videos/side-projects/product-management/signUpCheckYourEmail-3.mp4"
           controls="controls" style={{maxWidth: 400, borderRadius: 15}}>
    </video>


</Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid>

Once the email is successfully verified, the user gains access to log in to the system.
