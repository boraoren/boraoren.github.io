Transitioning from sketches to a functional feature is a journey filled with challenges and learning.
I had to consider not only the aesthetics but also the technical feasibility.
This phase involved countless iterations, as each detail in the sketch was scrutinized,
refined, and tested.

The launch of the 'Create Document' feature is just the beginning.
There's much more to come in this side project,
with each step aimed at enhancing functionality and user experience.
As I continue to develop and refine this tool,
I invite you to join me in this journey and share your feedback and ideas.
