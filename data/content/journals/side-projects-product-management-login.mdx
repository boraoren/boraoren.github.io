Implementing a login feature for a project management tool is crucial for security
and user management.

The process typically involves creating a secure login page
where users can enter their credentials. This page should connect
to a backend system that verifies the information against stored user data,
possibly using techniques like OAuth for social logins
or SAML for enterprise single sign-on. Ensuring data encryption,
like using HTTPS, and having a robust password recovery system are essential.

        The goal is to provide users with a seamless and
        secure experience while safeguarding the tool from unauthorized access.

__P.S:__ For enhanced security, implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) can add
an extra layer of protection.
