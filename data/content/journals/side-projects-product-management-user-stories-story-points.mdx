In Agile project management, a user story point is a unit of measure
used to express the overall effort required to implement a user story.
Story points are abstract and relative, reflecting the complexity, risks,
and effort involved, rather than time. They are used to estimate the work
and prioritize tasks during planning. Unlike hours or days, story points
allow teams to account for non-linear aspects of problem-solving,
like uncertainty or technical complexity.

        This helps in agile planning
        and sprint allocation, providing a more flexible approach to understanding
        and managing workload.
